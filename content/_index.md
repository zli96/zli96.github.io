I'm advised by [Aparna Chandramowlishwaran](https://hpcforge.eng.uci.edu/). My current research interest falls in the intersection among scientific computing, machine learning, and high performance computing. The current project involves solving the Poisson equation with domain decomposition method where each subdomain is solved by a pretrained Neural PDE solver. I have previously worked on and am still interested in parallel Tensor decomposition algorithms.

I got my BS in 2018 from University of Nebraska, Lincoln. I received my MS in 2022 at Wake Forest University, advised by [Grey Ballard](https://users.wfu.edu/ballard/index.html).
